# basic-Text-summarizer
This project is a Text Summarizer Application built using Python, Tkinter, and HuggingFace Transformers. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can enter text and generate a concise summary. The app uses a pre-trained transformer model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) through HuggingFaceâ€™s pipeline for summarization.
